## Description
**Skiller** is a platform (A mobile app) that connects students (either school or college students) who want to learn something or get mentor-ship in a specific field like programming, software, design, robotics, ... etc with tutors (who are undergraduates or fresh graduates) who are passionate and experienced about this field.

This allows these undergraduates to work as a part-time tutor with us. As it is very hard for undergraduates to find suitable and useful part-time jobs which are also very flexible as they are the ones who decide when they are free to give these tutoring sessions.

We choose the tutors to be undergraduates or fresh graduates so that the age gap between them and the students will be very small so that the tutors can transfer the knowledge to them easily.

The platform consists of **two applications**:

**Students App**

The first one is for students so that they can:
- Search for what they want to learn and find a list of tutors to choose from.
- Contains detailed tutors profiles which contain reviews, rating, what courses/sessions they give, their education and experience.
- Book the desired session.

**Tutors App**
For the tutors so that they can:
- Control their profiles and add courses/sessions.
- Accept and reject the requested sessions from students
